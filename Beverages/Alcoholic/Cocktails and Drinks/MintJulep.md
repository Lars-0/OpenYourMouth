# Mint Julep
A classic cocktail from the American south is the perfect companion for hot weather, horse racing, or watching the grass grow. While any bourbon whiskey will do, a wheated one like Maker's Mark or W.L. Weller's is traditional- it's more smooth and doesn't fight the mint like rye does.

## Ingredients
|Ingredient|Volume |
|:---------|:------|
| Simple Syrup |1 part|
| Bourbon Whiskey |1 part|
| Ice, crushed |Ample|
|Fresh peppermint leaves|1 sprig per serving|

## Procedure
1. Reserve a peppermint leaf or two for garnishing. Muddle the remainder of the peppermint with the simple syrup, to infuse, in the bottom of a chilled julep glass.
2. Thin the mixture with a little seltzer water.
3. Add bourbon and stir.
4. Top with ice and seltzer water. Stir to distribute muddled peppermint.
5. Garnish with remaining mint leaves.
