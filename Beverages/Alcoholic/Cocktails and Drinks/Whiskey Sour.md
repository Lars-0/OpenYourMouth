# Whiskey Sour
This bright cocktail is a quick and impressive classic. Use whatever Bourbon you have on hand- this can shine up even the lowest spirit.

Add the egg white if you want the iconic foam, but it will taste just as great without it if you're not a fan.

You can get creative with the garnish- besides the I've also had great sours with a sprig of thyme or other herbs, drops of bitters in the foam, or even a stalk of lemongrass.
