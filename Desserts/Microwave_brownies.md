###Tools needed.
* A bowl. (Medium sized.)
* A microwave.
* A spatula. (or spoon, anything you can mix with.)

###Mix the dry stuff.
mix in the bowl.
* 65g unsweetened cocoa powder
* 100g plain flour
* 200g sugar

>This can be stored for a while for faster brownies later.

###Add the rest.
* 150g butter (melted)
* 2 eggs


>Melt the butter in the microwave, that takes less time.

###Bake it!
Put your dough in a cup, on a plate, in a shoe. it doesn't matter.
cook it for as long as you want. but it finishes FAST, so keep you're eye on it.
also the dough puffs up to about twice the size when cooked, so keep that in mind when filling youre cup/container.
