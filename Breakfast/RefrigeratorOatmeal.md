# Refrigerator Oatmeal

## Description
A tangy fruity yogurt-based oatmeal that is great for more than just breakfast.

### Ingredients

|Ingredients | US    |Metric |
|:-----------|:------|:------|
| Rolled Oats | 3 cups | 700 ml |
| Good quality nonfat Greek yogurt | 24 fl oz | 700 ml |
| Milk | 2 cups | 500 ml |
| Good quality vanilla | 3 tbsp |
| Raspberry preserves | 7 - 8 fl oz | 200 - 235 ml |
| Chia seed | 6 tbsp |
| Raspberries [^1] | 1 lb | 0.5 kg |

[^1]: preferably fresh, but frozen work as well

If you like it more tangy, use buttermilk in place of plain milk. It is possible to substitute regular yogurt instead of Greek, but you'll need to use less milk.

### Instructions

1. Combine everything except the raspberries in a large bowl.
2. Optionally split the mixture into small serving sizes.
3. Leave in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours. 24 hours is better.
4. Enjoy

If you choose to split into servings (optional step 2), top the individual servings with the raspberries before putting the containers into the refrigerator. I like to use 1 pint freezer "jars", but washed lidded yogurt containers would work just as well.

If you skip the serving sizes, serve with fresh raspberries on top.
