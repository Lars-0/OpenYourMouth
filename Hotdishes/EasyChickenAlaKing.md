# Easy Chicken a la King

This dish is an easy way to use up cooked chicken or you can grab a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. Serve over rice, egg noodles or, like my mom used to do, dress it up with these: [Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Shells](http://www.pepperidgefarm.com/Images/Products/prdLarge_112172.jpg).
