### Preparation 


1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place a parchment paper over or lightly 
grease a baking sheet.

2. While the oven is preheating wrap the tofu in a clean and absorbant towel
and set a heavy object(like a cast iron skillet) on top of it to press the 
liquid out.


3. When the oven is preheated, dice tofu into 1/4th inch cubes and arrange 
them on the baking sheet. Bake for 26-30 minutes. Look for golden brown 
edges and a firm texture. Note that the longer it bakes the firmer and 
crispier the tofu will become. 

4. While the tofu bakes prepare the rice by boiling 12 cups of water in a 
large pot. Once it is boiling add rice and stir. Boil on high **uncovered**
for 30 minutes, then strain for 10 seconds and return to pot **removed** 
from the heat. Cover with a lid and let it steam for 10 minutes.

5. While the rice and tofu are cooking, prepare sauce by adding all sauce
ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined. Taste and ajust flavor as 
you see fit. More tamari or soy for saltiness, peanutbutter for creaminess,
brown sugar for sweetness, or chili garlic sauce for spiciness.

6. Once the tofu is done. add directly to sauce and marinate for 5 minutes.
stir occasionally. 

7. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot remove the tofu from 
sauce using a strainer or slotted spoon leaving most of the sauce behind.
Cook for 3-4 minutes stir occasionally until deep golden brown on all sides.
Lower the heat if tofu browns too quickly. Remove from pan and set aside. 

8. To the still hot pan add garlic, green onions peas and carrots. Saut√© for
3-4 minutes. Stir occasionally and season with 1 Tbsp tamari or soy sauce. 

9. Add cooked rice, tofu and remaining sauce and stir. Cook over medium-high
heat for 3-4 minutes. Stir frequently. 

10. Serve immediately.
