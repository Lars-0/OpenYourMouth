### Preparation

1. Mash the garlic, jalapeño, cilantro together with some salt and pepper.
2. Mix juice from 1 orange, juice from 2 juiced limes, vinegar, and the oil into the paste and stir together.
3. Marinade the steak in the created mixture. For an hour or 2 if you have flank, or for only 30 minutes if you precut stir-fry lengths.
4. If you have a flank you must cut the steak into really thin slices.
4. Prepare a flat top grill or stove with some oil set to a low-medium heat.
5. Cook the steak as you would cook bacon.

#### Serving

3. Place lettuce, then cheddar cheese, followed by any more toppings you require.
4. Cut up the last lime (or more than one) into wedges so that they can be squeezed on the
